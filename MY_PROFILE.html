<h2>PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3>
<p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test, typically based on psychological attributes and is used to determine differing strengths and types of personalities in a workplace or other setting. An online test produced the following results for me:<br> 
<br><i>ISTP: Introvert-Sensor-Thinker-Perceiver:
Introverts tend to be reflective, reserved and private. A popular misconception is that introverts are shy - this is not necessarily so. They draw their energy from their own thoughts and the time they spend alone. Introverts do not need people around them all the time.
Sensors live in the present. They rely on facts, handle practical matters well and like things to be concrete and measurable.
Thinkers make decisions using logic and impersonal analysis. They think with their heads rather than their hearts.
Perceivers prefer a lifestyle that is spontaneous, flexible and adaptable. They like an environment that is unstructured, and like to keep their options open.
People with ISTP personality type have a pragmatic approach, they are task oriented members of the team who generally focus more on the problem in front rather than the people who are involved. These people can probe troubles and have the ability to contribute with putting their efforts into the project. They have talent and are straightforward.</i></p>

<h3>Learning style test</h3>
<p>The Kolb helps to understand how a learning style affects problem solving, teamwork, handling conflict, communication and career choice. <br>An online test produced the following results for me:<br><br>
<i>Converging (doing and thinking – Abstract Conceptualisation/Active Experimentation). People with a converging learning style can solve problems and will use their learning to find solutions to practical issues. They prefer technical tasks and are less concerned with people and interpersonal aspects. People with a converging learning style are best at finding practical uses for ideas and theories. They can solve problems and make decisions by finding solutions to questions and problems. People with a converging learning style are more attracted to technical tasks and problems than social or interpersonal issues. A converging learning style enables specialist and technology abilities. People with a converging style like to experiment with new ideas, to simulate, and to work with practical applications.</i></p>

<h3>The Holland Code Career test</h3>
<p>The Holland Code (RIASEC) refers to both career theory and professional choice based on personality types. <br>An online test produced the following results for me:<br><br>
<i>Your Holland Code is CSE. You are an Organizer: As an Organizer, you like to work with data, processes, and systems. You enjoy putting things in order and completing tasks in a systematic fashion. You appreciate a structured work environment where rules, policies, and standard procedure are clear and well enforced. Organizers like their work best when they can carefully systematize processes to work toward well-defined goals. As an Organizer, your primary career goal will be to find a job where you can focus on the details and create reliable systems to produce.</i></p>

<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>The three tests produced results of a similar description. They indicate that I am task-orientated and that I would work well in an environment that is structured and systemised. The test results also agree that I may be suited for projects where I create systems, work on technical tasks, and that I think with my head more so than my heart . It is suggested that I have a pragmatic approach. This may mean that my best contribution to a team is to work on practical matters and to problem solve.<br><br>
I was surprised at how accurately the results of these tests reflect how I see myself. They also seem to correlate with what I’ve been told by others about the way I’m perceived. I actively and consciously base my decisions and my demeanour on good intentions what I believe is the right thing to do. When faced with a problem, I do my best to think rationally and base my response on facts rather than feelings.<br><br>
In my early working years, I struggled with confidence and was quite shy. I felt like working in a team would mean that my abilities would be limited due to this. I have since recognized the importance and benefit that is gained from teamwork. The benefit of teamwork is maximised by taking personality traits into account when forming a team so that roles are delegated based on strengths. I mediate and promote harmony amongst colleagues. I respect authority and team leaders. I’m passionate about my work. I am a quiet achiever. Taking this into account when forming a team will benefit my productivity. The more aware I become about my personality and my strengths, the more productive I can be.
