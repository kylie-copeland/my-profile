<h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>

<p>I’m fascinated by Moore’s law and the exponential growth of technology. I grew up in an exciting 
era for technology innovation and have obsessed with computers since childhood. I wanted to be a part of 
making exciting changes to the future using technology. Solving technical problems is an important aspect of 
computer science and is something I find incredibly satisfying. Computer Programming, Computer Systems Analysis 
and Software development are areas I have a particular interest in, and I am eager work towards a career 
in these IT sectors.</p>

<h3>Why I Chose RMIT</h3>
<p>In 2019, I completed a certificate IV in Information Technology Networking by correspondence with TAFE NSW. 
After completing that course, I knew that I wanted to continue my learning in this field and so I enrolled at 
RMIT University and completed the course Introduction to Computer Systems earlier this year. I discovered that 
RMIT University is an ideal environment for me to get my queries answered and to feed my desire to understand 
more about IT. I’m currently enrolled in Introduction to Information Technology and am excited to continue 
on to do further IT courses at RMIT.</p>

<h3>My Expectations of Study</h3>
<p>I hope to gain a better understanding of what’s involved in pursuing a career in Information Technology. 
Intro to IT will provide a steppingstone to the next level of higher education that I will need to complete, 
in order to pursue my goal of becoming an IT professional. I hope to advance and improve on my knowledge of the 
fundamentals of technology. Not only will it be valuable for working in an IT related field but, having a basic 
understanding of technology and how it is applied in the workplace is essential for professionals working in 
almost any industry.</p>
