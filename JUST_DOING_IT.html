<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>
<h3>Overview / Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Procrastinating can be the leading cause of disruption and stress in a person’s life and can limit the potential of those who are prone to delay tasks. There is a clear need for a tool to help effectively manage time and assist those that procrastinate to achieve better outcomes by creating a plan of action, prioritizing tasks, and establishing a productive routine.<br>
The purpose of the following report is to offer a possible solution that will address the need of a computerised technology that can assist breaking the habit of procrastination.<br>
With customised prompts, a mobile application would attempt to keep the user on track by reminding them to move on to the next task. This concept offers a possible solution for those who struggle to be punctual due to poor time management.<br>
A feasibility study was conducted to test the practical feasibility of such a tool, to discover the benefits of automating the process of managing time during the completion of tasks and to assess the need for a solution.  To provide a recommendation, research was conducted using internet searches, surveys, and interviews. The results that the research provided have been used to frame this report and its recommendations.<br>
It is recommended that the concept of a smartphone application, that can automate the processes involved in time management during the completion of a sequence of tasks, is developed. This report will outline the factors leading to the proposed solution. The report will also discuss and identify the technology tools that will allow for the development of this concept. It is concluded that this concept is feasible and will provide those with the structure that is needed to manage time more efficiently.<br><br></p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The process of completing a required sequence of tasks by a certain time can be difficult. According to Brandon Gaille, studies have shown that 1 in 5 adults identify themselves as procrastinators. Piers Steel, a business professor at the University of Calgory, noted in a 2007 study that strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, impulsiveness and organisation. (Steel, 2007). Currently, there are mobile applications that promise to assist the user to beat bad habits, prevent procrastination and meet deadlines. Fabulous: Daily Routine Planner is an increasingly popular smartphone app that boasts the features of a daily routine planner that personalises your routines. Another successful app that deserves a mention is Time Box. Among the many features that Time Box includes, it can allocate fixed time periods for activities to avoid procrastination. However, there is a need for a need for a simple, user-friendly smartphone application that can automate the processes involved with time management, without overwhelming the user with extra steps and features that may be irrelevant. Using an app that has too many side features and personalised approaches to help break the habit of procrastinating may be a detrimental distraction. By using a straightforward approach, this project proposal is a possible solution to this problem and can allow for the user to get their commitments done in a timely fashion instead of fashionably late.<br><br></p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>“You cannot avoid procrastination by just removing the constant distractions. However, you can do it with the help of time management in order to have a habit of getting things done.” (Gaille, n.d.)<br><br>
Just Doing It™ is a concept for a smartphone application. Using the information that the user inputs upon registration, the app will create a prioritised “to-do” list. The list of tasks will then be analysed to create and deploy a sequence of customisable alarms or “prompts”. This automated service will use a personal and secure online database to store and sort the information from the users input. Using simple algorithms, the input will to provide the data used to create personalised prompts. The intent of this concept is to assist in the time management of routine tasks.<br><br>
One example of when this may be useful is for the execution of completing the steps within the process of getting prepared to leave the house. To help prevent tardiness., the application could be used by those who have a recurring daily commitment that starts at the same time every day, such as attending work, class, picking up children from school. These commitments may require a regular routine to be completed by a certain time. Those that hit the snooze button multiple times before getting out of bed to get ready for work, wake up to the stress of now having a significantly shorter amount of time to get themselves out the door. Just Doing It™ is customisable and understands the importance of the individual tasks involved in the user’s regular routine and can help relieve this stress.<br><br>
Some of the features of the application may include:<br>
<dl>
<dt>Simple User Interface</dt>
<dd>- Clean user interface that makes it easy to get started.</dd>
<dt>In-app Datatbase</dt>
<dd>- A well-designed in-app database that can allow for quick responses to requests for completion of tasks.</dd>
<dt>Automated Prompts</dt>
<dd>- Automated prompts using input on registration.</dd>
<dt>Custom Schedule</dt>
<dd>- Ability to edit and rename scheduled prompts.</dd></dl>
Additional features may include:
<dl>
<dt>Configuration</dt>
<dd>- Customisable profiles and full control on configuration.</dd></dl>
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>- For users to more efficiently complete processes involved in managing time when completing daily tasks.<br><br>
- To implement effective and efficient systems to assist overall improvement to meeting deadlines.<br><br>
- Efficiency, productivity and improved changes to practices and management behaviour.<br><br>
- Improved decision making and better access to timely information to base decisions on.
</p>
