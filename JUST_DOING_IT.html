<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>

<h3>Overview / Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Procrastinating can be the leading cause of disruption and stress in a person’s life and can limit the 
potential of those who are prone to delay tasks. There is a clear need for a tool to help effectively manage 
time and assist those that procrastinate to achieve better outcomes by creating a plan of action, prioritising 
tasks, and establishing a productive routine.<br>
The purpose of the following report is to offer a possible solution that will address the need of a 
computerised technology that can assist breaking the habit of procrastination.<br>
With customised prompts, a mobile application would attempt to keep the user on track by reminding them to 
move on to the next task. This concept offers a possible solution for those who struggle to be punctual due 
to poor time management.<br>
A feasibility study was conducted to test the practical feasibility of such a tool, to discover the benefits 
of automating the process of managing time during the completion of tasks and to assess the need for a solution.  
To provide a recommendation, research was conducted using internet searches, surveys, and interviews. 
The results that the research provided have been used to frame this report and its recommendations.<br>
It is recommended that the concept of a smartphone application, that can automate the processes involved in 
time management during the completion of a sequence of tasks, is developed. This report will outline the 
factors leading to the proposed solution. The report will also discuss and identify the technology tools that 
will allow for the development of this concept. It is concluded that this concept is feasible and will provide 
those with the structure that is needed to manage time more efficiently.<br><br></p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The process of completing a required sequence of tasks by a certain time can be difficult. According to 
Brandon Gaille, studies have shown that 1 in 5 adults identify themselves as procrastinators. Piers Steel, a 
business professor at the University of Calgory, noted in a 2007 study that strong and consistent predictors 
of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, impulsiveness and organisation. (Steel, 2007). 
Currently, there are mobile applications that promise to assist the user to beat bad habits, prevent 
procrastination and meet deadlines. Fabulous: Daily Routine Planner is an increasingly popular smartphone 
application that boasts the features of a daily routine planner that personalises your routines. Another 
successful app that deserves a mention is Time Box. Among the many features that Time Box includes, it 
can allocate fixed time periods for activities to avoid procrastination. However, there is a need for a 
need for a simple, user-friendly smartphone application that can automate the processes involved with time 
management, without overwhelming the user with extra steps and features that may be irrelevant. Using an app 
that has too many side features and personalised approaches to help break the habit of procrastinating may be a 
detrimental distraction. By using a straightforward approach, this project proposal is a possible solution to 
this problem and can allow for the user to get their commitments done in a timely fashion instead of fashionably 
late.<br><br></p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>“You cannot avoid procrastination by just removing the constant distractions. However, you can do it with 
the help of time management in order to have a habit of getting things done.” (Gaille, n.d.)<br><br>
Just Doing It™ is a concept for a smartphone application. Using the information that the user inputs upon 
registration, the app will create a prioritised “to-do” list. The list of tasks will then be analysed to 
create and deploy a sequence of customisable alarms or “prompts”. This automated service will use a personal 
and secure online database to store and sort the information from the users input. Using simple algorithms, 
the input will to provide the data used to create personalised prompts. The intent of this concept is to 
assist in the time management of routine tasks.<br><br>
One example of when this may be useful is for the execution of completing the steps within the process of 
getting prepared to leave the house. To help prevent tardiness, the application could be used by those who 
have a recurring daily commitment that starts at the same time every day, such as attending work, class, 
picking up children from school. These commitments may require a regular routine to be completed by a certain 
time. Those that hit the snooze button multiple times before getting out of bed to get ready for work, wake up 
to the stress of now having a significantly shorter amount of time to get themselves out the door. 
Just Doing It™ is customisable and understands the importance of the individual tasks involved in the user’s 
regular routine and can help relieve this stress.<br><br>

Some of the features of the application may include:
  <li>Clean user interface that makes it easy to get started.</li><br>
  <li>A well-designed in-app database that can allow for quick responses to requests for completion of tasks.</li><br>
  <li>Automated prompts using input on registration.</li><br>
  <li>Ability to edit and rename scheduled prompts.</li><br><br>
Additional features may include:<br><br>
  <li>Customisable profiles and full control on configuration.</li>
</p><br>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
  <li>For users to more efficiently complete processes involved in managing time when completing daily tasks.</li><br>
  <li>To implement effective and efficient systems to assist overall improvement to meeting deadlines.</li><br>
  <li>Efficiency, productivity and improved changes to practices and management behaviour.</li><br>
  <li>Improved decision making and better access to timely information to base decisions on.</li><br>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
<dl>
  <dt>Costs</dt>
    <dd>– there is no budget for the project and costs cannot exceed $0.</dd>
  <dt>Deadline</dt>
    <dd>– completion of the project is required within the next 8 weeks.</dd>
  <dt>Platform</dt>
    <dd>– the new system should conform to current existing platforms.</dd>
  <dt>Skills</dt>
    <dd>– the project requires specific skills to develop the project.</dd>
  <dt>Legal</dt>
    <dd>– the project must remain compliant with legal requirements and regulations to retain and report specific 
information.</dd></p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>There are many tools and technologies that are available to use for the development of this concept. 
An internet search was conducted to discover options of suitable software that could be used for the development 
of this project. Using a Windows Operating System, some of the software that may be required are the Microsoft 
Office programs, which can be used for creating the databases, a mobile app builder and a JavaScript library. 
An updated Android or iOS smartphone with a reliable internet connection may be useful during the final production 
stages as a means of testing the prototype. The options were then compared and carefully considered. Based on this 
analysis, the following components are recommended:</p>

<h4>Software</h4>
  <li>Buildfire - A mobile application builder.</li><br>
  <li>BuildFire.js – A library used to build custom functionality with JavaScript.</li><br>
<h4>Hardware</h4>
  <li>PC or Laptop – 64-bit environment with at least 8GB of ram.</li><br>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>The skills that are required to develop this concept are primarily related to basic computer programming, 
information technologies and teamwork. While a certification degree in this field may not be needed, it is 
recommended that as a minimum, the developer or developers have some knowledge of Java, GitHub and have advanced 
computer and internet skills. If the concept were to be developed by multiple developers, the ability to work 
effectively as part of a team is a necessity. Competence in devices and software operations, digital communication 
and collaboration, digital content creation, digital safety and problem solving via digital technologies may 
be required.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, <i>Just Doing It</i><sup>TM</sup> is a proposed concept and approval is needed 
to progress to the development phase. The small amount of feedback received so far, has been generally 
favourable. The detailed analysis and investigation of this project have determined that the development 
of this concept is feasible and recommended. It should be taken into consideration that opting for a team 
of developers to produce this concept, as oppose to a single developer, would significantly improve the 
overall standard of the result.</p>
