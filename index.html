<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p> My grandfather, originally from Cyprus, has taught me that "every problem has a solution", which are words that have resonated with me my whole life.
Born and raised in Sydney, I live what some would describe as a typical Aussie lifestyle. My family, on my mother's side, immigrated here from England.
As a child, I enjoyed experiencing the arts, and have even tried my hand at acting and attended the National Institute of Dramatic Art. I played the piano for many years, and I also loved to read. I read books by authors such as George Orwell and Agatha Christie. My Father gave me a copy of Animal Farm that he had owned as a child. It became one of my most treasured possessions.
In recent years I've enjoyed learning the art of crochet by watching tutorials on YouTube and using patterns I've found online. Initially, the satisfaction in completing a successful project had me hooked (no pun intended) but I also found it to be quite therapeutic and a great way for me to practice mindfulness. I now get excited experimenting with different stitches and developing interesting and functional patterns of my own.</p>
<h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
<h3>My interest in IT</h3>
<p>The Information Technology industry will always be in demand for skilful professionals because technological innovation never stops. The reason being its exponential growth. I want to be a part of making exciting changes to the future using technology. Solving technical problems is something I've always found to be incredibly satisfying and have obsessed with computers since childhood. The past three years, I have worked as a part-time online administration assistant, but Artificial Intelligence (AI) and software development are the areas I have a particular interest in, and I am eager to further study related to these sectors.</p>
<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
<p>I'm currently enrolled with RMIT University in which I am studying the course, Introduction to Information Technology. Prior to this course, I completed a certificate IV in Information Technology Networking by correspondence with TAFE NSW. After completing that course, I knew that I wanted to continue my learning in this field and RMIT University is an ideal environment for me to get my queries answered and to feed my desire to understand more about IT.</p>
<h3>My expectations of study</h3>
<p>I hope to gain a better understanding of what's involved in pursuing a career in Information Technology. Intro to IT will provide a steppingstone to the next level of higher education that I will need to complete, in order to pursue my goal of becoming an IT professional. In general, I hope to advance and improve on my knowledge of the fundamentals of technology. Not only will it be valuable for working in an IT related field but, having a basic understanding of technology and how it is applied in the workplace is essential for professionals working in almost any industry.</p>
<h2>IDEAL JOB</h2>
