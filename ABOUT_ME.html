<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>Kylie Copeland is an Online Administrator currently studying Information Technology at RMIT University. Her areas of focus as an IT student are Computer Programming, IT Networking and Computer Systems Analysis.<br><br>
Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, Kylie spent her childhood reading books by authors such as George Orwell and Agatha Christie and enjoyed experiencing the arts. She tried her hand at acting while attending the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and played the piano for many years. During the 1990’s and 2000’s, her interests and curiosity turned towards the development of computers systems and technology innovation. In, more recent years, she has completed Introduction to Computer Systems, at RMIT University and has obtained multiple certificates from her studies at TAFE NSW, including Information Technology Networking, Certificate IV.<br><br>
Besides working towards her academic goals and achievements, Kylie loves to crochet. Initially, crochet was a therapeutic and relaxing way to  practice mindfulness, that had her hooked (no pun intended). Now, she enjoys experimenting with different stitches and can develop interesting and functional crochet patterns of her own.<br>
