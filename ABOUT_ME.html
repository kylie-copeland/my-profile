<h2>ABOUT</h2>

<img src="about_photo.jpeg" alt="Kylie">
<p>Kylie Copeland is an Online Administrator currently studying Information Technology at RMIT University. 
Her areas of focus as an IT student are Computer Programming, IT Networking and Computer Systems Analysis.
Kylie has completed Introduction to Computer Systems, at RMIT University and has obtained multiple certificates 
from her studies at TAFE NSW, including Information Technology Networking, Certificate IV.<br><br>

Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, Kylie spent her childhood reading books by authors such as George Orwell 
and Agatha Christie and enjoyed experiencing the arts. She tried her hand at acting while attending the National 
Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and played the piano for many years. As technology advanced, her interests 
and curiosity turned towards the development of computers systems and technology innovation.<br><br>

Besides working towards her academic goals and achievements, Kylie loves to crochet. Initially, crochet was a 
therapeutic and relaxing way to practice mindfulness, that had her hooked (no pun intended!). Now, she enjoys 
experimenting with different stitches and can develop interesting and functional crochet patterns of her own.</p>
